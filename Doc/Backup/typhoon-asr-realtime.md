# Typhoon ASR Realtime Model Evaluation

## Overview
This document evaluates the Typhoon ASR Realtime model (https://huggingface.co/scb10x/typhoon-asr-realtime) as an alternative to OpenAI Whisper for Thai language transcription in the SRT Generator project.

## Model Information

### Source
- **Model**: Typhoon ASR Realtime
- **Provider**: SCB10X (Siam Commercial Bank)
- **Hugging Face URL**: https://huggingface.co/scb10x/typhoon-asr-realtime

### Key Features (to be researched)
- Real-time speech recognition capabilities
- Thai language specialization
- GPU acceleration support
- Model size and resource requirements
- Performance benchmarks

## Evaluation Plan

### Comparison Metrics
1. **Transcription Accuracy**
   - Word Error Rate (WER) for Thai language
   - Contextual understanding
   - Handling of Thai-specific sounds and tones

2. **Performance**
   - Processing speed (real-time factor)
   - GPU utilization
   - Memory usage
   - Model loading time

3. **Integration**
   - Ease of implementation
   - API compatibility
   - Dependencies required

### Test Methodology
1. Use existing audio files (Jasmali.MP3, ขนมครก.MP3) for testing
2. Compare transcription results with current Whisper large model output
3. Measure processing time with and without GPU
4. Evaluate resource consumption

## Current Whisper Performance Baseline

### Jasmali.MP3 Analysis
From `Jasmali.large.srt`:
- Successfully transcribed Thai promotional content
- Good segmentation of speech
- Accurate timing information
- Some minor word recognition issues (e.g., "กลิ่นดาราสาวสวย" vs "กลิ่นด้านลาสาวสวย")

### Issues Identified
- `Jasmali.whisper.srt` shows complete failure (all segments marked as "[ไม่มีข้อความพูด]")
- `Jasmali.whisper2.srt` shows poor transcription quality with many errors
- Inconsistent results between different Whisper attempts

## GPU Support Requirements

### Current Implementation
- The current code has basic GPU support through PyTorch
- Models loaded with `map_location=torch.device('cpu')` by default
- No explicit GPU detection or optimization

### Needed Improvements
1. Automatic GPU detection
2. Memory management for large models
3. Fallback mechanisms when GPU is not available
4. Performance optimization for GPU processing

## Implementation Considerations

### Dependencies
- Need to identify specific dependencies for Typhoon ASR
- Potential conflicts with current Whisper setup
- Additional libraries that might be required

### Model Integration
- Loading mechanism for Typhoon model
- API compatibility with existing transcription pipeline
- Model storage and management

### Performance Optimization
- Batch processing capabilities
- Real-time processing features
- Memory optimization techniques

## Next Steps
1. Research Typhoon ASR model documentation
2. Create test implementation
3. Run comparative benchmarks
4. Evaluate integration complexity
5. Make recommendation based on findings

## Notes
- The Doc folder should be added to .gitignore
- All test results and benchmarks should be documented here
- Implementation details should be added to the main README.md after evaluation
